# YouTube Setup Guide

---

## What You're Setting Up

We're connecting your YouTube channel so the automation can upload Shorts automatically. You'll be:
1. Creating a Google Cloud project
2. Enabling the YouTube API
3. Getting OAuth credentials
4. Connecting to n8n

Think of this as giving our system permission to post videos on your YouTube channel.

---

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Google account with YouTube channel
- ✅ Admin access to the channel
- ✅ 20 minutes of focused time
- ✅ Access to a computer (not phone)

---

## Important Upload Limits

⚠️ **YouTube has strict daily quotas:**
- **6 videos per day maximum**
- This is **the bottleneck** for our entire system
- Quota resets at midnight Pacific Time

**What this means:**
Your automation is configured to respect this limit. Don't try to upload more than 6 videos in a day - YouTube will reject them.

---

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Go to Google Cloud Console

1. Open: **https://console.cloud.google.com**
2. Sign in with your Google account (the one that owns your YouTube channel)
3. You'll see the Google Cloud Console dashboard

---

### Step 2: Create a New Project

1. At the top of the page, click the **project dropdown** (usually says "Select a project")
2. Click **"NEW PROJECT"** button (top right of the popup)
3. Fill in the form:

   **Project name:**
   ```
   Social Media Automation
   ```
   *(Or any name you like)*

   **Organization:** Leave as "No organization" (unless you have a Google Workspace)

   **Location:** Leave as-is

4. Click **"CREATE"**
5. Wait 10-20 seconds for the project to be created

4. Click the blue **"ENABLE"** button

5. Wait a few seconds - you'll be redirected to the API overview page

---

### Step 4: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

Before creating credentials, we need to set up the consent screen (what you see when you authorize the app).

1. In the left sidebar, click **"APIs & Services"** → **"OAuth consent screen"**

2. Choose user type:
   - Select **"External"** (unless you have Google Workspace, then use Internal)

### Step 5: Create OAuth Credentials

1. In the left sidebar, click **"APIs & Services"** → **"Credentials"**

2. At the top, click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** → **"OAuth client ID"**

3. **Application type:**
   - Select **"Web application"**

4. **Name:**
   ```
   n8n YouTube Integration
   ```

5. **Authorized redirect URIs:**
   - Click **"+ ADD URI"**
   - Paste this URL exactly:
     ```
     YOUR_N8N_PUBLIC_URL/rest/oauth2-credential/callback
     ```
   - Click outside the box to save

6. Click **"CREATE"**

7. A popup will appear with your credentials:
   ```
   Your Client ID:
   [long string].apps.googleusercontent.com

   [shorter string]
   ```

8. **IMPORTANT:** Click the **download icon** (⬇️) to download the JSON file, OR copy both values and save them securely

### Step 6: Connect YouTube to n8n

Now you'll connect YouTube to your n8n instance using the credentials you just created.

1. Log in to your n8n instance: YOUR_N8N_PUBLIC_URL
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon in the left sidebar)
3. Click on **Credentials**
4. Click **"Add Credential"** button
5. Search for and select **"YouTube OAuth2 API"**
6. Fill in the credential form:
   - **Name:** `YouTube - [Your Channel Name]`
   - **Client ID:** Paste your Client ID from Step 5
   - **Client Secret:** Paste your Client Secret from Step 5
7. Click **"Connect my account"** button
8. You'll see a Google sign-in popup:
   - **Choose the Google account** that owns your YouTube channel
   - You'll see: **"Social Media Video Automation wants to access your Google Account"**
   - Review the permissions:
     - View and manage your YouTube account
     - Upload videos
   - Click **"Continue"** or **"Allow"**
9. You'll be redirected back to n8n
10. Click **"Save"** to save the credential

**What just happened:**
You gave the automation permission to post videos to your YouTube channel. This permission doesn't expire and can be revoked anytime from your Google Account settings.

---

### Step 7: Test the Connection

Once your complete workflow is set up (after all platforms are configured):

1. Upload a test video to your `/first_upload` Dropbox folder
2. The automation will process it
3. Within 1-2 minutes, check your YouTube Studio
4. Go to **"Content"** tab
5. You should see your video

**Video details that are auto-filled:**
- **Title:** From filename
- **Visibility:** Unlisted (can be changed)
- **Category:** People & Blogs

## Token Information

YouTube tokens never expire.

- **Token Type:** OAuth2 Refresh Token
- **Expiration:** Never (as long as you don't revoke permission)
- **Renewal:** Automatic - n8n manages it
- **Manual Action Needed:** ❌ None!

The OAuth2 system uses "refresh tokens" that let us get new "access tokens" whenever needed. You'll never have to manually do anything.

**To revoke access (if needed):**
1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions
2. Find "Social Media Video Automation"
3. Click "Remove access"

---

## YouTube Quota Details

Understanding the limits is important for planning your uploads.

### Quota Units

YouTube measures API usage in "units":
- **Daily quota:** 10,000 units
- **Video upload:** ~1,600 units
- **Math:** 10,000 ÷ 1,600 = 6.25 videos

So you can safely upload **6 videos per day**.

### Quota Reset

- **When:** Midnight Pacific Time (PT)
- **Where to check:** Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Dashboard

### What Happens If You Hit the Limit

If you try to upload a 7th video in a day:
- YouTube API returns a quota error
- Our system logs it to Airtable
- You get a Telegram alert
- The video will be retried after midnight

**Best practice:** Upload 6 or fewer videos per day.

---

## Video Privacy Settings

By default, videos are uploaded as **"Unlisted"**. Here are your options:

| Setting | Who Can See It | Best For |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Private** | Only you | Testing |
| **Unlisted** | Anyone with the link | Sharing with specific people |
| **Public** | Everyone | Maximum reach |

**To change default privacy:**
1. Tell me your preference
2. I'll update the workflow
3. Or you can manually change each video in YouTube Studio

---

## YouTube Shorts Requirements

For videos to appear in the Shorts feed, they MUST:

✅ **Duration:** 60 seconds or less
✅ **Aspect ratio:** Vertical (9:16) - 1080x1920
✅ **Format:** MP4
✅ **Orientation:** Portrait (vertical)

If your video doesn't meet these specs, it'll still upload but won't show in Shorts - it'll be a regular video.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Project creation failed"
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're logged into the correct Google account
- Try a different project name
- Check if you have any billing issues (Cloud projects are free for basic API usage)

### "Can't find YouTube Data API v3"
**Solution:**
- Use the exact search term: `YouTube Data API v3`
- It should be the first result with a red play button icon

### "OAuth consent screen shows warning"
**Solution:** That's normal! Google shows a warning because your app isn't "verified" (which costs money and takes weeks). This is fine for personal use. Click "Advanced" → "Go to [your app] (unsafe)" to proceed.

### "Video uploaded but not appearing in Shorts"
**Possible causes:**
1. Video is longer than 60 seconds
2. Video is horizontal (16:9) instead of vertical (9:16)
3. YouTube is still processing (can take 10-30 minutes)

**Solution:**
- Wait 30 minutes for YouTube processing
- Check video specs (must be 1080x1920, <60 seconds)
- Videos will show as regular uploads if not Shorts-compliant

### "Quota exceeded error"
**Solution:**
- You've hit the 6 videos/day limit
- Wait until midnight Pacific Time
- Check quota usage: Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Dashboard

### "Authorization failed"
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're authorizing with the correct Google account
- Check that YouTube channel is linked to that account
- Try revoking and re-authorizing

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I change video title/description after upload?**
A: Yes! Either manually in YouTube Studio, or I can configure the automation to use custom titles.

**Q: Will this work with a brand account?**
A: Yes, as long as you have manage permissions on the brand account.

**Q: Can I upload to multiple channels?**
A: Not simultaneously with this setup. We'd need to create separate workflows for each channel.

**Q: What if I want videos to be Public immediately?**
A: Tell me and I'll change the default privacy setting in the workflow.

**Q: Does this use my personal YouTube Studio?**
A: Yes, videos appear in your YouTube Studio like you uploaded them manually.

**Q: Can I schedule uploads for specific times?**
A: Yes! We can set up the automation to run at specific times (e.g., 9am, 3pm, 9pm).
