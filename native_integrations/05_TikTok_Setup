## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Go to TikTok Developer Portal

2. Sign in with your TikTok account (the one you'll post to)
3. Click **"Manage apps"**
4. Click **"Create an app"** or **"Connect an app"**

---

### Step 2: Fill in Basic Information

**App icon:**
- Upload your logo (1024x1024 px, up to 5MB, JPEG/PNG)

**App name:**
- Example: `automashaa` or `Social Media Video Automation`

**Category:**
- Select: **Education** (or relevant category)

**Description:**
- Example: *"I am a content creator building a personal automation tool to manage my own TikTok content."*
- Keep it under 120 characters

**Terms of Service URL:**
- Your public Terms of Service page
- Example: `https://yourusername.github.io/tiktok-app-terms/terms`

**Privacy Policy URL:**
- Your public Privacy Policy page
- Example: `https://yourusername.github.io/tiktok-app-terms/privacy`

**Platforms:**
- Select: **Web** and **Desktop**

**Web/Desktop URL:**
- Your public website or GitHub page
- Example: `https://yourusername.github.io/tiktok-app-terms/`

---

### Step 3: Configure Products and Scopes

**Products to add:**
1. **Login Kit**
2. **Content Posting API**
   - Enable **"Direct Post"** option

**Scopes (permissions) to request:**
- ✅ `user.info.basic` - Read user profile info
- ✅ `video.upload` - Upload videos as drafts
- ✅ `video.publish` - Publish videos directly

---

### Step 4: App Review Information

**Explain how you'll use each scope:**

Use this template (or similar):
```
How I will use each scope:

1. user.info.basic - To authenticate and verify my own TikTok account

2. video.upload - To upload my pre-created video content from my personal
   library to my TikTok account

3. video.publish - To publish my uploaded videos directly to my TikTok profile

My Workflow:
- I create video content and store it in my cloud storage (Dropbox)
- My automation tool uploads these videos to my TikTok account on a scheduled basis
- This allows me to maintain a consistent posting schedule without manual uploads

I am an automation enthusiast building this tool for my personal content
management. All videos uploaded are my own original content. This automation
saves me time while helping me maintain consistent engagement with my audience.

Expected usage: 5-10 video uploads per day to my own account only.
```

---

### Step 5: Upload Demo Video

**Requirements:**
- Format: MP4 or MOV
- Size: Up to 50MB
- Must show: Complete end-to-end flow of your integration

**What to show in the video:**
1. Your website/GitHub page where app is hosted
2. n8n workflow interface (can show test workflow)
3. TikTok authentication process
4. Video upload process (even if simulated)
5. Video appearing on TikTok profile

**Tips:**
- Use screen recording software
- Show the URL in browser address bar
- Demonstrate each scope/permission you requested
- Keep it under 2-3 minutes

---

### Step 6: Configure Login Kit

**Redirect URI:**
```
YOUR_N8N_PUBLIC_URL/rest/oauth2-credential/callback
```

**Platforms:** Select **Web** and **Desktop**

---

### Step 7: Submit for Review

1. Review all information
2. Click **"Submit for review"**
3. Wait for TikTok to review (5-7 business days)
4. You'll receive an email with approval status

---

## After Approval

Once TikTok approves your app:

1. **Get your credentials:**
   - Client Key
   - Client Secret

2. **Save them securely** in your password manager

3. **We'll configure together:**
   - Add TikTok OAuth2 credentials in n8n
   - Test the connection
   - Verify video upload works

⚠️ **We'll do the n8n configuration together during our setup meeting.**

## TikTok Video Requirements

Your videos must meet these specs:

- **Access Token Expiration:** 24 hours
- **Refresh Token Expiration:** Never (as long as user doesn't revoke)
